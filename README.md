# Big Data

This is a Chrome or Firefox browser extension that replaces all occurrences 
of the phrase *big data* on a page with the phrase *chronic flatulence* for
great juvenile humor justice!

- [Direct download of Chrome crx file](https://github.com/brianshumate/chronic-flatulence/blob/master/ChronicFlatulence.crx?raw=true)
- [Direct download of Firefox xpi file](https://github.com/brianshumate/big-data/blob/master/BigData.xpi?raw=true)

This code is derived from the work of Steven Frank's excellent
[cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension and
plays very well with it. :smile:

## Chrome Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. In Chrome, choose **Window** > **Extensions**
3. Drag `BigData.crx` onto the page that appears
4. Visit a website containing the term *big data*
5. Look around and laugh nervously

## Firefox Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. In Firefox, choose **Tools** > **Add-ons** and select **Extensions**
3. Drag `BigData.xpi` onto the page that appears
4. Visit a website containing the term *big data*
5. Look around and laugh nervously

NOTE: The Firefox version is not signed, and you'll get a warning about using
it, but feel free to inspect the content of the `.xpi` file (it is just a
zip file) to see that the source code is harmless or light the whole thing on
fire and push it out the window; it's [your prerogative](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cDLZqe735k).

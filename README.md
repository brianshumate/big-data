# Big Data

This is a Chrome or Firefox browser extension that replaces all occurrences 
of the phrase *big data* on a page with the phrase *chronic flatulence* for
great juvenile humor justice!

This code is derived from the work of Steven Frank's excellent
[cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension and
plays very well with it. :smile:

# Big Data


This is a Chrome browser extension that replaces all occurrences of the phrase
*big data* on a page with the phrase *chronic flatulence*.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/brianshumate/chronic-flatulence/blob/master/ChronicFlatulence.crx?raw=true)

This code is derived from the work of Steven Frank's excellent
[cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension and
plays very well with it. :)

## Installation

1. In Chrome, choose **Window** > **Extensions**
2. Drag `ChronicFlatulence.crx` into the page that appears
3. Visit a website containing the term *big data*
4. Look around and laugh nervously

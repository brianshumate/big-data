# Big Data


This is a Chrome browser extension that replaces all occurrences of the term
'big data' on a page with the term 'chronic flatulence'.

[Direct download of crx file](https://github.com/brianshumate/chronic-flatulence/blob/master/ChronicFlatulence.crx?raw=true)

This code is derived from the work of Steven Frank's  [cloud-to-butt](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) extension and
plays very well with it. :)

## Installation

1. In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.
2. Drag ChronicFlatulence.crx into the page that appears.
3. Laugh and look around nervously
